# TextUtilis
It is a utility app that allows you to manipulate your text in the way you want.

It is my first React-based project. I have made this project while learning React.

It provides various features that allow you to manipulate your text which are as follows:
1. Converting your text to uppercase
2. Converting your text to lowercase
3. Clear the text
4. Change the font family
5. Remove unwanted spaces between words
6. Reverse the text

The website has a feature that enables you to enable Dark Mode on the website.

Additionally, it gives you an alert whenever you perform any task on the website.
